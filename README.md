# Department Dashboard (Web Engineering - Project -- MERN Stack)

Design a web application to build dashboard where a user can login and view information about the Compute Software Engineering Department, MCS.

Be creative and design your own dashboards. Some ideas which can be incorporated in the dashboards are:
 - It can have a Faculty section that shows the information of that faculty like Name, Address, Phone, Email, position, how long they have been employed, start date, publications, courses taught etc. Similarly, there can be a student section as well.
 - You can include in graphs and charts that show 
   - Enrollments by course
   - Attendance by course
   - Day attendance comparison 
   - Projects completed
   - Research publications charts etc.
 - You can also add a place for the administration to make a department wide announcement that would show up as a banner upon login.

Following must be kept in mind while developing the project: -
 - You will work in a group of 4 students each
 - Each student will clearly specify what portion of the project he contributed towards.
 - You will submit project report including complete explanation of project functionality with screenshots, software requirements to run the project and source code on a CD.
 - You can use any database for the project. You can even use data stored in JSON files for viewing in the dashboards.
 - Bonus marks will be given to the groups who have 
   - developed a completed web application including frontend, backend and database design.
   - Implement websockets for pushing notifications to users
